# Continuum

Continuum is a minimal iOS app and widget that shows you the % of your day that has
passed and the % of your day that is left.

## Why Continuum?

One of the lies I tell myself most often is that I don't have enough time to do the
things I want to do. Life can sometimes feel like tight loop between exercise,
work, and sleep, with a little breath on the weekends.

I found that I was mentally switching-off just after finishing work, but I'd
stay awake until midnight. For me, this meant that for over 40% of my waking day, I was
in or near a "switched-off" cognitive state. I wanted to change that, and use my time
for reading, writing, drawing, learning, finishing half-baked projects, and so on.

Continuum is a reminder that you probably have the time you wish you had, and that you
can make use of it.
